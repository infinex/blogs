# Access the internal of Word Documents to restore corrupted files


Rename the Word file to a Zip (.docx to .zip).

Open Windows Explorer, locate, and then open the saved compressed file that has a .zip file name extension. 

*Note*

To be able to change the 'docx' extension to 'zip', you have to have Windows Explorer's options set to show the extensions.

Select the word folder, and then open the media folder to display the graphics or embedding folder.

Delete (or move to a new folder) some graphics/embedding bin files to reduce the file size.

Rename the file back to docx and open with Word. If Word displays some errors, because it cannot find some files, click Yes to recover the contents.

There will be placeholders for the deleted (or moved images).

Right-click the image placeholder, select Change Picture and browse to the folders where the pictures are saved to select the pictures.

Click the arrow next to the Insert button and select Link to File.

Save the document.
